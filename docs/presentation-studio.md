# Presentation Studio - concepts, owner map and status

Entry page for the Presentation Studio (handoff `jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio`): a structured, editable, rehearsable and presentable **Presentation** that Jarvis can author and
deliver. It **holds no behaviour contract yet**: it names the canonical concepts, says who will own each, and tracks status per section. When a section gets its own contract page or code,
that owner wins and this row is updated in the same commit.

Status: **Level 2 skeleton** (named concepts + owner map + status). No Studio code exists on `main` yet; every row below is `planned` unless it says otherwise.
Written by Slice 01 (contract audit) from `docs/07-integration-map.md` of the handoff (`tasks/jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio/docs/`).

## Not to be confused with

| Existing thing | Where | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRESENTATION **interaction mode** (ambient lane, explicit address, silence by default) | [presentation-mode.md](presentation-mode.md) and its owner pages | The Studio **consumes** it; it never loosens its authority rules (ambient speech has no authority, explicit address wins) |
| **Artifact** (capture evidence, `jart_` ids) | [artifacts.md](artifacts.md) | A Presentation is not an Artifact; no `Artifact*` name is reused |
| **Prefab** (sandboxed HTML/CSS/JS window definition) | [prefabs.md](prefabs.md) | Each Studio scene is rendered by a prefab instance; the Studio adds no renderer and no catalog |
| **Scene** (the single global constellation scene) | [scene-model.md](scene-model.md) | A Studio *logical scene* is not a scene-service object; only the displayed one is a `window` |

## Canonical concepts (Level 1 terms; contracts are Level 2/3 as the Slices land)

| Concept | Meaning | Owner (planned) | Contract | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | durable aggregate: variants, resource refs, active variant | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio.py`, `core/presentation_studio_service.py`, store `adapters/file_presentation_studio_store.py` | this page, Slice 02 | planned |
| Presentation Variant | creative branch of a whole presentation; immutable id, monotonic display number, title, provenance | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_variants.py` | Slice 16 | planned |
| Studio scene + control | logical scene pinned to a prefab `(id, version)`; curated typed controls bound to manifest inputs | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_scene.py` | Slice 04 | planned |
| Scene-local variant | lightweight alternative of one scene inside a variant | `presentation_studio_variants.py` | Slice 17 | planned |
| Semantic edit (3 tiers) | control patch / structural patch / source edit; one layer for voice and GUI; preview vs commit | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_edit.py`, `core/presentation_studio_edit.py` | Slice 05 | planned |
| Scene hot reload | scene-local rebuild with state preservation and rollback | `core/presentation_studio_reload.py` | Slice 06 | planned |
| Autosave + undo | atomic continuous save of the active variant; bounded in-memory undo/redo | `core/presentation_studio_autosave.py` | Slice 08 | planned |
| Art direction | structured profile with provenance (provided / inferred / generated) | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_art_direction.py` | Slice 09 | planned |
| Score, cues, timing | multi-track script, explicit silence, armable cues, soft/locked timing | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_score.py` | Slice 10 | planned |
| Playback runtime | roles (user presenter / Jarvis presenter / rehearsal), position, detours, "where are we" | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_playback.py`, `core/presentation_studio_playback.py` | Slice 12 | planned |
| Armed cue following | ambient speech may only satisfy a pre-armed cue id, bound to a pre-authorized reversible action | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_cues.py`, `runtime/presentation_studio_cue_follower.py` | Slice 13 + amendment of [presentation-addressed-turn.md](presentation-addressed-turn.md) section 12 | planned |
| Jarvis presenter, locked sequences | scripted speech and deterministic AV sequences through the existing speech path | `core/presentation_studio_presenter.py` | Slice 14 (needs the speech-authority decision) | planned |
| Rehearsal | practice, pause-edit-resume, no durable transcript | playback runtime | Slice 15 | planned |
| Variant compare / mix | side-by-side, synchronized navigation, selective composition into a new child | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_compose.py` | Slice 19 | planned |
| Template / promotion | whole-variant, scene, DA or motion promoted to the shared library | `presentation_studio_template.py` | Slice 20 | planned |
| Generic fullscreen surface | real browser fullscreen of a host element; armed request + user gesture; explicit `needs_gesture` / `unsupported` | `jarvis/domain/surface_fullscreen.py`, `runtime/control_center_fullscreen.js` | Slice 03 | implemented (Level 3) |
| Agent / voice operations | one MCP server `jarvis-presentation`, `presentation_*` tools, ids from choice providers | `jarvis/runtime/presentation_studio_mcp.py` | Slice 21, [mcp/tool-contract.md](mcp/tool-contract.md) | planned |

Exact names (ids, routes, events, tools): `tasks/jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio/docs/09-canonical-names.md` until Slice 02 moves the stable parts into this page.

## Generic fullscreen surface (Level 3, Slice 03)

Contract and failure modes: [prefabs.md](prefabs.md) › *Host fullscreen*; surface mode:
[scene-model.md](scene-model.md) › *Surface mode: fullscreen*; Human check recipe:
[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) › *Plein écran d'une surface*. It is a generic surface capability
(`SurfaceFullscreenRequest` / `SurfaceFullscreenState`, `window.JarvisFullscreen`), not a presentation fork.

What later Slices may rely on, and nothing else:

- `JarvisFullscreen.enter({object_id, display, keys, arm_s})` / `exit()` / `onNavigate(fn)` / `state()` on the page
  (Slices 12 and 18 call these; `enter` armed without a gesture, entered with one).
- `POST /api/fullscreen/commands {action: "enter"|"exit", ...}` and `GET /api/fullscreen/state` for the agent side
  (Slice 21 wraps them as `presentation_fullscreen`). An `enter` answer is `needs_gesture`: **the agent must say the
  user has to click, never that it is fullscreen.** `entered` is read from `GET /api/fullscreen/state`.
- Navigation keys (next, previous, first, last) arrive through `onNavigate` while fullscreen; the frame relays none.
- Slice 22 (hardening) re-checks fullscreen restore; the physical checks (Escape key, multi-monitor, permission
  prompt) stay Human checks.

## Binding facts established by the Slice 01 audit (details and evidence in the handoff's `07-integration-map.md`)

- There is no desktop host. Fullscreen is the browser Fullscreen API on a **host element**; a prefab frame cannot fullscreen itself (permissions policy) and a voice request alone cannot start it (user activation).
- The prefab library caps versions per id (64) and ids (512) and has no deletion: Tier-3 source editing needs a capacity decision first.
- In PRESENTATION mode a scripted Jarvis line is withheld by the speech gate unless the policy is amended or the presenter runs outside that mode.
- Studio operations are Core services behind their own MCP server; they are **not** Tool Brain UI intents. The `ui_intent_publish` channel is currently broken on `main` (handoff Issue 01).
- Cue following runs in the Voice process, durable state in Core; ambient transcription needs the OpenAI voice stack.

## Documentation levels (target at hand-off close)

| Concept group | Today | Target |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| PRESENTATION mode, ambient lane, working set | 3 | 3 (unchanged; one narrow amendment, Slice 13) |
| Scene / prefab foundation | 3 | 3 |
| Tool Brain contract | 3 (channel broken on `main`) | 3 |
| Generic fullscreen surface | 3 (Slice 03) | 3 |
| Presentation, scenes/controls, edit, hot reload, autosave, DA, score, playback, cues, rehearsal, variants, compare/mix, promotion, agent operations | 0-1 | 3 each |

There is no `docs/CONTEXT.md` or documentation-level registry in this repository: the level of a concept is stated in its page header (`Status: Level N`), as in [presentation-mode.md](presentation-mode.md).
