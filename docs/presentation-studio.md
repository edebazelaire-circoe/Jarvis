# Presentation Studio - concepts, owner map and status

Entry page for the Presentation Studio (handoff `jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio`): a structured, editable, rehearsable and presentable **Presentation** that Jarvis can author and
deliver. It **holds no behaviour contract yet**: it names the canonical concepts, says who will own each, and tracks status per section. When a section gets its own contract page or code,
that owner wins and this row is updated in the same commit.

Status: **Level 2 skeleton** for the page as a whole; the *Presentation contract* section below is **Level 3** (Slice 02: domain, port, file store, Core service, Core routes, typed client, conformance tests).
Every other row is `planned` unless it says otherwise. Written by Slice 01 (contract audit) from `docs/07-integration-map.md` of the handoff (`tasks/jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio/docs/`); Slice 02 added the contract.

## Not to be confused with

| Existing thing | Where | Relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRESENTATION **interaction mode** (ambient lane, explicit address, silence by default) | [presentation-mode.md](presentation-mode.md) and its owner pages | The Studio **consumes** it; it never loosens its authority rules (ambient speech has no authority, explicit address wins) |
| **Artifact** (capture evidence, `jart_` ids) | [artifacts.md](artifacts.md) | A Presentation is not an Artifact; no `Artifact*` name is reused |
| **Prefab** (sandboxed HTML/CSS/JS window definition) | [prefabs.md](prefabs.md) | Each Studio scene is rendered by a prefab instance; the Studio adds no renderer and no catalog |
| **Scene** (the single global constellation scene) | [scene-model.md](scene-model.md) | A Studio *logical scene* is not a scene-service object; only the displayed one is a `window` |

## Canonical concepts (Level 1 terms; contracts are Level 2/3 as the Slices land)

| Concept | Meaning | Owner (planned) | Contract | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | durable aggregate: variants, resource refs, active variant | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio.py`, `core/presentation_studio_service.py`, store `adapters/file_presentation_studio_store.py` | [Presentation contract](#presentation-contract-level-3) below, Slice 02 | **implemented (Level 3)** |
| Presentation Variant | creative branch of a whole presentation; immutable id, monotonic display number, title, provenance | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_variants.py` | Slice 16 | planned |
| Studio scene + control | logical scene pinned to a prefab `(id, version)`; curated typed controls bound to manifest inputs | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_scene.py` | Slice 04 | planned |
| Scene-local variant | lightweight alternative of one scene inside a variant | `presentation_studio_variants.py` | Slice 17 | planned |
| Semantic edit (3 tiers) | control patch / structural patch / source edit; one layer for voice and GUI; preview vs commit | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_edit.py`, `core/presentation_studio_edit.py` | Slice 05 | planned |
| Scene hot reload | scene-local rebuild with state preservation and rollback | `core/presentation_studio_reload.py` | Slice 06 | planned |
| Autosave + undo | atomic continuous save of the active variant; bounded in-memory undo/redo | `core/presentation_studio_autosave.py` | Slice 08 | planned |
| Art direction | structured profile with provenance (provided / inferred / generated) | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_art_direction.py` | Slice 09 | planned |
| Score, cues, timing | multi-track script, explicit silence, armable cues, soft/locked timing | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_score.py` | Slice 10 | planned |
| Playback runtime | roles (user presenter / Jarvis presenter / rehearsal), position, detours, "where are we" | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_playback.py`, `core/presentation_studio_playback.py` | Slice 12 | planned |
| Armed cue following | ambient speech may only satisfy a pre-armed cue id, bound to a pre-authorized reversible action | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_cues.py`, `runtime/presentation_studio_cue_follower.py` | Slice 13 + amendment of [presentation-addressed-turn.md](presentation-addressed-turn.md) section 12 | planned |
| Jarvis presenter, locked sequences | scripted speech and deterministic AV sequences through the existing speech path | `core/presentation_studio_presenter.py` | Slice 14 (needs the speech-authority decision) | planned |
| Rehearsal | practice, pause-edit-resume, no durable transcript | playback runtime | Slice 15 | planned |
| Variant compare / mix | side-by-side, synchronized navigation, selective composition into a new child | `jarvis/domain/presentation_studio_compose.py` | Slice 19 | planned |
| Template / promotion | whole-variant, scene, DA or motion promoted to the shared library | `presentation_studio_template.py` | Slice 20 | planned |
| Generic fullscreen surface | real browser fullscreen of a host element; armed request + user gesture; explicit `needs_gesture` / `unsupported` | `jarvis/domain/surface_fullscreen.py`, `runtime/control_center_fullscreen.js` | Slice 03 | planned |
| Agent / voice operations | one MCP server `jarvis-presentation`, `presentation_*` tools, ids from choice providers | `jarvis/runtime/presentation_studio_mcp.py` | Slice 21, [mcp/tool-contract.md](mcp/tool-contract.md) | planned |

Exact names (ids, routes, events, tools): `tasks/jarvis-interactive-presentation-studio/docs/09-canonical-names.md`; the Presentation ids, routes, error codes and storage tree are now stated in the contract section below (Slice 02).

## Presentation contract (Level 3)

Status: implemented by Slice 02. Conformance: `tests/unit/test_presentation_studio_{domain,store,crash,service,routes,docs}.py`,
fixtures `tests/fixtures/presentation_studio/`. A Presentation can be created, saved, loaded, listed and validated **independently of
playback and of any UI**; nothing here imports the scene service, the prefab service, a renderer or the Control Center.

### What it holds, and what it never holds

| Document | Holds (references, never copies) |
| --- | --- |
| `Presentation` (`presentation.json`) | `presentation_id` `pst_<32 hex>`, `title` (<= 80, one printable line), `active_variant_id`, `variant_counter` (last number handed out, monotone, never reused), the variant index `[{variant_id, variant_number}]` (1..64), `resources` (<= 64, `{kind, locator, title}`), `revision`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |
| `PresentationVariant` (`variants/<variant_id>.json`) | `variant_id` `psv_<32 hex>`, `variant_number`, `title`, `parent_variant_id` (the only graph trace, cycles refused; graph operations are Slice 16), ordered `scenes` (<= 64) of `{scene_id: pss_<12 hex>, prefab: {id, version}}`, `art_direction_id` (`psd_<12 hex>` or null, content is Slice 09), `score_id` (`psr_<12 hex>` or null, content is Slice 10), `revision`, timestamps |

- A scene reference is the logical scene id and the **exact** prefab pin `(id, version)` (`PrefabRef`, `jarvis/domain/prefab.py`). No manifest, template, style, behavior, props or data
  field exists in the schema; the unknown-key refusal makes copying prefab fields impossible, not merely discouraged. Scene controls and values are Slice 04.
- A resource is the existing `ResourceReference` (`jarvis/domain/presentation_working_set.py`: allowed-scheme locators, no markup, <= 300 chars) stored as `{kind, locator, title}`.
  The `descriptor` payload is **not** stored (references, never payloads). Kind `scene_object` and `scene:` locators are refused: a scene object id is a runtime handle.
- **Runtime-only state is never persisted.** Scene-service object ids, window or DOM or frame handles, playback state and score position, reveal progress, detours, the auxiliary resource stack and the undo/redo
  stack have no field. Every document and request body is an exact object: an unknown key is refused, and a key that names runtime state (`jarvis/domain/presentation_studio.py` `RUNTIME_KEYS`) is refused with its own code
  `presentation_studio_runtime_state_refused`, so the mistake is visible instead of generic. Later Slices keep that state in memory (playback, Slice 12; undo ring, Slice 08).
- Identity (`presentation_id`, `variant_id`, `variant_number`, `parent_variant_id`, `created_at`) is immutable: a save body has no such field.

### Versioning and compatibility

Every document carries `{"schema": "jarvis.presentation_studio.presentation" | "jarvis.presentation_studio.variant", "schema_version": 1}`.

- A document with a **newer** `schema_version` than this JARVIS reads is refused (`presentation_studio_unsupported_schema_version`, HTTP 409), never read best-effort. The file is left untouched: a save reads the stored
  document first, so a newer file is never overwritten by an older JARVIS. The listing names it in `problems`.
- An **older** version goes through `UPGRADES[schema][n]` (`n -> n+1`, one step per version, empty at v1; `upgrade_document`). A missing step is `corrupt_document`, never a guess.
- Adding a field is a version bump with an upgrade step; the unknown-key refusal is why. There is no `_MIGRATIONS` entry: this is a file store, not part of `jarvis.sqlite3` (see *Storage*).

### Revisions

`revision` starts at 1 and grows by one per save of that document. `PUT` bodies carry `expected_revision`; a mismatch is `presentation_studio_stale_revision` (409, "reload, then retry"), nothing is written. The Presentation revision counts only its own
changes (title, resources, active variant); a variant save touches only its variant file. This is the seam for the semantic edit API (Slice 05, `apply_if`-style basis) and autosave (Slice 08).

### Core service and routes

`PresentationStudioService` (`jarvis/core/presentation_studio_service.py`) is the sole authority: `create`, `get`, `get_variant`, `list_presentations`, `save_presentation`, `save_variant`, `validate`. Core is the single writer; writes and reads take the same lock (a read never meets an atomic replace in flight; the store also re-inspects up to 4 times if a save from elsewhere lands between its inspection and open);
reads hit the disk every time (the file is the truth, also after a restart). Routes: `jarvis/protocol/presentation_studio_routes.py`, typed client: `LocalCoreClient.presentation_studio_*` (`jarvis/protocol/client.py`). There is no Control Center relay yet (Slice 05+ adds it
with the actor forced to `user`); the client constant `STUDIO_PREFIX` is not in `FORWARDABLE_PREFIXES` on purpose.

| Method | Core route | Body -> answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations[?limit]` | `{presentations: [{presentation_id, title, active_variant_id, variant_count, resource_count, revision, updated_at}], problems: [{presentation_id, code, message}]}` |
| POST | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations` | `{title}` -> 201 `{presentation, variants}` (variant #1, empty, active) |
| POST | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations/validate` | `{presentation, variants}` in disk format -> `{ok, errors: [{code, message}]}` (first error only), nothing written |
| GET | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations/{presentation_id}` | `{presentation, variants}` |
| PUT | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations/{presentation_id}` | `{expected_revision, title, active_variant_id, resources}` -> the `presentation` document |
| GET | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations/{presentation_id}/variants/{variant_id}` | the `variant` document |
| PUT | `/v1/presentation-studio/presentations/{presentation_id}/variants/{variant_id}` | `{expected_revision, title, scenes, art_direction_id, score_id}` -> the `variant` document |

### Failures: typed, visible, logged

`PresentationStudioErrorCode` (`jarvis/domain/presentation_studio.py`), envelope `{"error": {"code", "message"}}`, message without absolute path:

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `presentation_studio_invalid` | 400 | input refused (shape, bound, id, prefab pin, resource) |
| `presentation_studio_runtime_state_refused` | 400 | a runtime-only key or handle in a persistent document or body |
| `presentation_studio_unknown_presentation`, `presentation_studio_unknown_variant` | 404 | no such id (a malformed id is "unknown", never a path) |
| `presentation_studio_stale_revision` | 409 | `expected_revision` differs from the stored revision |
| `presentation_studio_unsupported_schema_version` | 409 | stored document newer than this JARVIS; file untouched |
| `presentation_studio_corrupt_document` | 409 | stored document unreadable, oversize, linked, inconsistent, or an indexed variant missing |
| `presentation_studio_already_exists`, `presentation_studio_limit_reached` | 409 | id taken; 256 presentations, 64 variants/scenes/resources, or a 256 KiB document exceeded |
| `presentation_studio_storage_io` | 500 | disk, link/junction refusal, path limit, missing data root: the real cause is in the message |
| `invalid_request`, `core_unavailable`, `internal_error` | 400, 503, 500 | malformed query or body (not JSON, duplicate key, > 256 KiB) / Core not ready / unexpected |

Diagnostics `core.presentation_studio.{started,swept,created,saved,listed,validated,refused}` at `info` (ids, codes, counts; never titles, locators or content), and at `error`
(which puts them in the Error Logs viewer) `failed` (storage, corrupt or newer document), `unreadable` (one presentation unusable while listing: it is named in `problems` and the others still list),
`sweep_failed`, `unexpected` (any non-typed exception at the route boundary, with the real cause).

### Storage (decision (a): file store, recorded by Slice 02)

Decision: a file store under `<data_root>/presentations/` (`jarvis/adapters/file_presentation_studio_store.py`, port `jarvis/ports/presentation_studio.py`), **not** a `jarvis.sqlite3` v9 migration. Reasons:
(1) no schema bump or `tests/schema` snapshot for a store whose unit is one document; (2) per-variant isolation (D15/D16) is one file per variant, so autosave of the active variant (Slice 08) rewrites one file, not a shared database;
(3) atomic replace, staged publication, folder defences and the startup sweep are existing, tested precedents (`FilePrefabLibrary`, `file_replace`, `safe_folders`); (4) the presentation is a document the user may back up or move,
which a row in a shared SQLite state cannot be; (5) Core is the single writer, so there is no concurrency that SQLite would resolve better. No hard reason for (b) was found. The cost accepted: no multi-file transaction (below).
Versioning is therefore per file (`schema_version` + `UPGRADES`), not `_MIGRATIONS`.

```
<data_root>/presentations/<presentation_id>/presentation.json
<data_root>/presentations/<presentation_id>/variants/<variant_id>.json
<data_root>/presentations/.staging-<16 hex>/          # a creation in progress; swept at start
```

- **Atomic file writes**: unique temporary beside the target, `fsync`, `replace_with_retry` (`os.replace`, bounded retry on a Windows lock). A crash leaves the old text whole or the new text whole; a leftover `*.<8 hex>.tmp` is swept at the next start and never blocks a save.
- **Atomic creation**: the whole folder is built in `.staging-*` (variants first, manifest last), then renamed; `os.rename` fails if the target exists. There is never a presentation folder without its manifest.
- **Multi-file operations** write variants first and `presentation.json` last; today no operation touches both. Reads reconcile (`check_consistency`): an indexed variant that is missing is `corrupt_document`, not silently dropped.
- **Defences** (`safe_folders`): absolute root, no link/junction/reparse point, Windows path limit, ids validated as exact-shape path components, files read by `lstat` + `fstat` (same inode, regular, <= 256 KiB, UTF-8), bounded retry when Windows refuses an open for a few milliseconds.
- **Never deletes a document**: `sweep` removes only `.staging-*` and our `*.tmp`. Archiving a variant (Slice 16) moves, never removes.
- Proof: `tests/unit/test_presentation_studio_crash.py` kills a real writer subprocess at varied instants (mutation-checked: an in-place write fails it) and a creator, and kills at the worst deterministic point (complete temporary, replace not done).

### Seams left for later Slices (not built here)

| Seam | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| scene controls, values, prefab mapping to the stage window | Slice 04 (adds fields to `SceneRef` through a version bump) |
| semantic edits, `expected_revision` as the edit basis, actor, relay | Slice 05 |
| debounced autosave, undo/redo ring (memory only) | Slice 08 |
| art direction and score content behind `art_direction_id` / `score_id` | Slices 09, 10 |
| variant create/switch/archive, `variant_counter` increments, `archive/<variant_id>.json` | Slice 16 |

## Binding facts established by the Slice 01 audit (details and evidence in the handoff's `07-integration-map.md`)

- There is no desktop host. Fullscreen is the browser Fullscreen API on a **host element**; a prefab frame cannot fullscreen itself (permissions policy) and a voice request alone cannot start it (user activation).
- The prefab library caps versions per id (64) and ids (512) and has no deletion: Tier-3 source editing needs a capacity decision first.
- In PRESENTATION mode a scripted Jarvis line is withheld by the speech gate unless the policy is amended or the presenter runs outside that mode.
- Studio operations are Core services behind their own MCP server; they are **not** Tool Brain UI intents. The `ui_intent_publish` channel is currently broken on `main` (handoff Issue 01).
- Cue following runs in the Voice process, durable state in Core; ambient transcription needs the OpenAI voice stack.

## Documentation levels (target at hand-off close)

| Concept group | Today | Target |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| PRESENTATION mode, ambient lane, working set | 3 | 3 (unchanged; one narrow amendment, Slice 13) |
| Scene / prefab foundation | 3 | 3 |
| Tool Brain contract | 3 (channel broken on `main`) | 3 |
| Generic fullscreen surface | 0 | 3 |
| Presentation artifact (identity, variants as references, scene refs, DA/score refs, resources, storage) | 1-2 | 3 (**done**, Slice 02) |
| scenes/controls, edit, hot reload, autosave, DA, score, playback, cues, rehearsal, variants, compare/mix, promotion, agent operations | 0-1 | 3 each |

There is no `docs/CONTEXT.md` or documentation-level registry in this repository: the level of a concept is stated in its page header (`Status: Level N`), as in [presentation-mode.md](presentation-mode.md).
